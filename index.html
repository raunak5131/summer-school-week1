  I am currently exploring the exciting world of software development through the 
  Summer School at IIT Hyderabad. This program has introduced me to fundamental 
  tools and technologies such as Git, Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), HTML, 
  and the collaborative workflows used in modern development environments.

<p>
  I have learned how to track and manage versions of my code, collaborate on GitHub, 
  and structure web pages using semantic HTML. These experiences have helped me 
  understand the foundations of open-source development and the importance of clean, 
  readable code. I am excited to continue this journey, build more projects, and 
  deepen my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies in the coming weeks.
